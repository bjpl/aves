## Migration 1: Bounding Box Format Normalization

### Script Analysis

**File:** `/backend/scripts/run-bounding-box-migration.sh`
**SQL Migration:** `/backend/src/database/migrations/012_normalize_bounding_box_format.sql`

#### Script Safety Review: ✅ APPROVED

**Positive Safety Features:**
- ✅ Uses `set -e` (exit on error)
- ✅ Validates environment variables before execution
- ✅ Requires explicit user confirmation ("yes")
- ✅ Uses `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` for psql (transaction rollback on error)
- ✅ Clear output and logging
- ✅ Documents next steps after completion

**No Security Issues Found:**
- ❌ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ❌ No hardcoded credentials
- ❌ No dangerous operations without confirmation
- ❌ No file system manipulation
- ❌ No network operations beyond database connection

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding a `--dry-run` flag for testing
- Consider logging to file for audit trail
- Add database backup verification before execution

### SQL Migration Analysis

**File:** `/backend/src/database/migrations/012_normalize_bounding_box_format.sql`

#### SQL Safety Review: ✅ APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

**Safety Features:**

1. **Automatic Backups (Lines 16-22)**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS annotations_bounding_box_backup AS
   SELECT id, bounding_box, updated_at FROM annotations;

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_annotation_items_bounding_box_backup AS
   SELECT id, bounding_box, updated_at FROM ai_annotation_items;
   ```
   - Creates backup before any modifications
   - Uses IF NOT EXISTS (idempotent)
   - Stores minimal columns needed for rollback

2. **Idempotent Function (Lines 28-64)**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION normalize_bounding_box(bbox JSONB)
   ```
   - Checks if already in nested format first
   - Returns unchanged if already correct
   - Safe to run multiple times
   - No side effects (IMMUTABLE)

3. **Pre-Migration Analysis (Lines 71-117)**
   - Counts rows in each format
   - Provides visibility into impact
   - No data modifications in this phase

4. **Selective Updates (Lines 124-127, 146-149)**
   ```sql
   WHERE bounding_box ? 'x' AND NOT (bounding_box ? 'topLeft')
   ```
   - Only updates rows needing conversion
   - Skips already-converted rows
   - Updates timestamp for audit trail

5. **Post-Migration Validation (Lines 168-202)**
   - Verifies all rows are in correct format
   - Raises warnings if issues found
   - Provides clear success/failure indicators

**Potential Issues Identified:**

1. **MEDIUM:** No explicit transaction wrapper
   - **Impact:** If migration fails mid-way, some rows may be converted while others aren't
   - **Mitigation:** psql's `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` causes automatic rollback
   - **Recommendation:** Add explicit BEGIN/COMMIT for clarity

2. **LOW:** Updated rows get new timestamps
   - **Impact:** `updated_at` changes for all migrated rows
   - **Mitigation:** Original timestamps preserved in backup tables
   - **Note:** This is actually desirable for audit trail

3. **LOW:** No index optimization after updates
   - **Impact:** Indexes may be slightly fragmented
   - **Mitigation:** PostgreSQL handles this automatically
   - **Recommendation:** Consider VACUUM ANALYZE after large migrations

### Estimated Impact Analysis

#### To Be Determined From Production Data

Run these queries against production to determine impact:

```sql
-- Query 1: Row counts by format
SELECT
  'annotations' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bounding_box ? 'x' AND NOT (bounding_box ? 'topLeft')) as flat_format_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bounding_box ? 'topLeft') as nested_format_count,
  COUNT(*) as total_count,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('annotations')) as table_size
FROM annotations
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'ai_annotation_items',
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bounding_box ? 'x' AND NOT (bounding_box ? 'topLeft')),
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bounding_box ? 'topLeft'),
  COUNT(*),
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('ai_annotation_items'))
FROM ai_annotation_items;

-- Query 2: Sample data inspection
SELECT
  'annotations' as table_name,
  id,
  bounding_box,
  CASE
    WHEN bounding_box ? 'topLeft' THEN 'nested'
    WHEN bounding_box ? 'x' THEN 'flat'
    ELSE 'unknown'
  END as format
FROM annotations
LIMIT 10;

-- Query 3: Disk space for backups
SELECT
  pg_size_pretty(
    pg_relation_size('annotations') +
    pg_relation_size('ai_annotation_items')
  ) as backup_disk_needed;
```

**Expected Impact Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Rows | Duration | Backup Size | Downtime |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Small | <1,000 | <1 sec | <1 MB | None |
| Medium | 1,000-10,000 | 1-5 sec | 1-10 MB | None |
| Large | 10,000-100,000 | 5-30 sec | 10-100 MB | None |
| Very Large | >100,000 | 30-300 sec | >100 MB | Consider maintenance window |

## Migration 2: Admin User Setup

### Script Analysis

**File:** `/backend/scripts/set-admin.sql`

#### SQL Safety Review: ✅ APPROVED

**Safety Features:**
- ✅ Simple, single-purpose query
- ✅ Uses WHERE clause to target specific user
- ✅ Includes verification query
- ✅ Provides two options (user_meta_data vs app_metadata)
- ✅ Well-documented with comments
- ✅ Alternative approach commented out

**Security Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Requires manual execution (intentional security measure)
- ⚠️ Must replace placeholder email before execution
- ✅ No SQL injection risk (template only)
- ✅ No bulk operations (single user at a time)

### SQL Commands That Would Execute

**Option 1 (Recommended):**
```sql
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = jsonb_set(
  COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
  '{role}',
  '"admin"'::jsonb
)
WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
-- Expected: UPDATE 1
```

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as user_role,
  raw_app_metadata->>'role' as app_role
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your-actual-email@example.com';
-- Expected: 1 row with user_role = 'admin'
```

### Estimated Impact

- **Table:** `auth.users`
- **Rows Modified:** 1
- **Lock Duration:** <10ms (row-level lock)
- **Downtime:** None
- **Backup Size:** Negligible
- **Reversibility:** 100% (simple UPDATE to remove role)

### Pre-Flight Checklist

**User Verification:**
- [ ] User exists in database (check with SELECT first)
- [ ] User email is correct and verified
- [ ] User has completed signup process
- [ ] User email address confirmed with stakeholder

**Access Verification:**
- [ ] Supabase dashboard access confirmed
- [ ] SQL Editor permissions verified
- [ ] You have UPDATE privilege on auth.users

**Application Verification:**
- [ ] Application code checks user metadata for admin role
- [ ] Admin features implemented and tested
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) configured
- [ ] JWT token includes role claim

### Execution Procedure

1. **Pre-Execution Check:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, created_at, confirmed_at
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'target-email@example.com';
   ```
   Verify user exists and email is confirmed.

2. **Execute Update:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE auth.users
   SET raw_user_meta_data = jsonb_set(
     COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
     '{role}',
     '"admin"'::jsonb
   )
   WHERE email = 'target-email@example.com';
   ```
   Expected output: "Success. 1 rows affected."

3. **Verify Update:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as role
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'target-email@example.com';
   ```
   Expected: role = 'admin'

4. **Application Test:**
   - Log out current session
   - Log in as admin user
   - Verify admin features accessible
   - Check for errors in console

### Expected Output

```
UPDATE 1

-- Verification query output:
 id                                   | email                      | user_role | app_role
--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|----------
 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 | target-email@example.com  | admin     | null
```
