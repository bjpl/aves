## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Unified Report Format Template

**Context**: Multiple daily reports were using inconsistent formats, making it difficult to track progress and compare sessions across time.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Manual standardization**: Manually update each report - Pros: Full control. Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone
2. **Automated template application**: Create unified template and apply systematically - Pros: Consistent, scalable. Cons: May lose some context

**Decision**: Automated template application with manual review

**Rationale**: This approach provides the best balance between consistency and preservation of important context like ROI analysis. The systematic approach ensures all future reports follow the same structure.

**Trade-offs**: Some minor reformatting was needed, but no critical content was lost.

---

### Decision 2: Agent Configuration Architecture

**Context**: Need for sophisticated multi-agent coordination to handle complex development workflows.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Minimal agent set**: Only core agents - Pros: Simple. Cons: Limited capabilities
2. **Comprehensive agent ecosystem**: Full suite of specialized agents - Pros: Maximum flexibility. Cons: Higher complexity

**Decision**: Comprehensive agent ecosystem with clear organization

**Rationale**: The comprehensive approach enables sophisticated workflows for different project needs (SPARC, GitHub integration, performance optimization) while the clear organizational structure keeps complexity manageable.

**Trade-offs**: Increased initial setup complexity, but significantly better long-term capabilities.
