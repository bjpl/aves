## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Full-Stack Architecture Documentation

**Context**: Aves is a complex full-stack application with multiple integrated systems

**Options Considered**:
1. **High-Level Overview** - Pros: Quick to create, easy to digest Cons: Missing critical details, insufficient for architecture work
2. **Comprehensive Multi-Layer** - Pros: Complete coverage, detailed reference Cons: Extensive documentation effort

**Decision**: Complete multi-layer documentation covering all 12 technology domains

**Rationale**:
- Infrastructure layer defines deployment and scaling capabilities
- Frontend stack determines user experience and client architecture
- Backend services handle business logic and data processing
- Database systems manage data persistence and retrieval
- Security implementations protect application and user data
- DevOps pipelines enable continuous delivery
- Monitoring ensures operational visibility
- External integrations extend application capabilities

Each layer critical to understanding complete system architecture.

**Trade-offs**: Significant documentation effort but essential for architectural decision-making and system evolution

---

### Decision 2: Security and DevOps Emphasis

**Context**: Modern applications require robust security and automated operations

**Options Considered**:
1. **Basic Coverage** - Pros: Simpler documentation Cons: Insufficient detail for security/ops decisions
2. **Detailed Implementation** - Pros: Complete security posture, clear operational processes Cons: More extensive documentation

**Decision**: Comprehensive security and DevOps documentation with detailed implementations

**Rationale**:
- Security is critical for user data protection and compliance
- DevOps automation enables rapid, reliable deployments
- Monitoring and observability essential for production operations
- Complete documentation supports security audits and operational planning

**Trade-offs**: More extensive documentation but critical for production-quality operations
