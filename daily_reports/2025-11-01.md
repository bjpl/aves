**Status**: Completed
**Commit**: `d3c0521`
**Author**: Claude Code

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed deployment authentication issues
- Added development environment auth bypass
- Resolved production deployment blockers

---

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Development Authentication Bypass

**Context**: Need to test deployment without full authentication setup

**Options Considered**:
1. **No bypass** - Pros: More secure. Cons: Blocks testing
2. **Environment-based bypass** - Pros: Enables testing. Cons: Security consideration

**Decision**: Environment-based development auth bypass

**Rationale**: Enables rapid testing while maintaining production security

**Trade-offs**: Must ensure bypass is only active in development environment

---

### Decision 2: Stats Endpoint Debugging Strategy

**Context**: Stats endpoint experiencing routing and response issues

**Options Considered**:
1. **Minimal logging** - Pros: Clean code. Cons: Hard to debug
2. **Comprehensive logging** - Pros: Full visibility. Cons: Verbose

**Decision**: Comprehensive logging with detailed debugging

**Rationale**: Provides full visibility into issue root cause

**Trade-offs**: More verbose logs but faster issue resolution
