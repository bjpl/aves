## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Pull Request Integration Strategy

**Context**: Need to integrate user testing preparation into main codebase

**Options Considered**:
1. **Direct merge** - Pros: Fast. Cons: Less review
2. **PR review process** - Pros: Quality assurance. Cons: More time

**Decision**: Formal pull request review and merge

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality and documentation completeness before integration

**Trade-offs**: Additional review time but higher quality integration
