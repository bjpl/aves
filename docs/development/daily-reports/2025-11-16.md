## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Claude Sonnet 4.5 Integration

**Context**: Need to leverage latest AI capabilities for annotation quality

**Options Considered**:
1. **Stay with existing model** - Pros: Stable. Cons: Limited capabilities
2. **Upgrade to Sonnet 4.5** - Pros: Enhanced capabilities. Cons: API changes

**Decision**: Upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4.5 with neural ensemble

**Rationale**: Provides significant annotation quality improvements

**Trade-offs**: API integration updates but substantial quality gains

---

### Decision 2: Neural Ensemble Implementation

**Context**: Need to maximize AI annotation accuracy and reliability

**Options Considered**:
1. **Single model approach** - Pros: Simple. Cons: Limited accuracy
2. **Neural ensemble** - Pros: Higher accuracy. Cons: More complexity

**Decision**: Implement neural ensemble for production AI

**Rationale**: Significantly improves annotation accuracy through multiple strategies

**Trade-offs**: Increased complexity but production-ready accuracy

---

### Decision 3: Repository Cleanup Strategy

**Context**: Auto-generated files cluttering repository

**Options Considered**:
1. **Manual cleanup** - Pros: Control. Cons: Ongoing maintenance
2. **Enhanced .gitignore** - Pros: Automated. Cons: Risk of excluding needed files

**Decision**: Update .gitignore with comprehensive exclusion patterns

**Rationale**: Automates repository hygiene and reduces maintenance burden

**Trade-offs**: Must ensure legitimate files aren't excluded
