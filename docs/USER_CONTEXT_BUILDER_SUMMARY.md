## Overview

Successfully implemented the **User Context Builder** service for Phase 2 intelligent exercise generation. This service analyzes user performance data to create personalized context for AI-powered exercise generation.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Core Service Implementation

**File:** `backend/src/services/userContextBuilder.ts` (450+ lines)

**Key Classes & Interfaces:**
- `UserContextBuilder` - Main service class
- `UserContext` - Complete context interface
- `UserPerformance` - Performance metrics
- `ExerciseHistoryItem` - Exercise history data
- `TopicStats` - Per-topic statistics
- `Level` - Skill level type ('beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced')
- `Difficulty` - Difficulty rating (1-5)

**Core Methods Implemented:**
✅ `buildContext(userId)` - Build complete user context
✅ `getUserPerformance(userId)` - Get overall performance metrics
✅ `getExerciseHistory(userId, limit)` - Fetch recent exercise history
✅ `calculateLevel(performance)` - Classify user skill level
✅ `calculateDifficulty(history, performance)` - Adaptive difficulty (1-5)
✅ `analyzeTopics(history)` - Per-topic performance analysis
✅ `getUnexploredTopics(userId)` - Find new topics to introduce
✅ `getCurrentStreak(history)` - Calculate success streak
✅ `getContextSummary(context)` - Generate readable summary

---

## 2. Context Building Strategy

### Level Classification

**Algorithm:**
```
if (totalExercises < 20 OR accuracy < 60%)
  → BEGINNER

if (totalExercises > 50 AND accuracy > 85%)
  → ADVANCED

else
  → INTERMEDIATE
```

**Rationale:**
- New users start as beginners
- High-performing experienced users advance
- Moderate performers stay intermediate

---

## 3. Difficulty Adjustment Rules

### Base Difficulty
- **New users** (< 10 exercises): Start at 1
- **High performers** (accuracy > 85%): Base 4
- **Struggling users** (accuracy < 60%): Base 2
- **Average users**: Base 3

### Adaptive Adjustments
Based on last 10 exercises:

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Recent accuracy > 85% AND streak > 5 | +1 difficulty | User ready for challenge |
| Recent accuracy < 60% | -1 difficulty | User needs easier content |
| Accuracy 75-85% AND streak > 10 | +0.5 difficulty | Gradual progression |
| Otherwise | Maintain | Steady state |

**Range:** Always between 1 (easiest) and 5 (hardest)

---

## 4. Topic Classification Thresholds

### Weak Topics (Need Practice)
- **Criteria:** Accuracy < 70% with ≥3 attempts
- **Selection:** Top 5 weakest topics
- **Usage:** Prioritized in exercise generation

### Mastered Topics (Maintenance Review)
- **Criteria:** Accuracy > 90% with ≥3 attempts
- **Selection:** Top 5 strongest topics
- **Usage:** Occasional reinforcement

### New Topics (Exploration)
- **Criteria:** Never attempted by user
- **Selection:** Up to 10 unexplored topics
- **Usage:** Gradual introduction for variety

---

## 5. Performance Analysis Approach

### Metrics Tracked

**Overall Performance:**
- Total exercises completed
- Correct answers count
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Average time per exercise

**Streak Analysis:**
- Current streak: Consecutive correct from most recent
- Longest streak: Maximum consecutive correct in history

**Topic Performance:**
- Per-topic accuracy
- Attempt frequency
- Average completion time
- Last practice date

### Recent Errors Tracking
- Last 5 incorrect exercises
- Used for targeted review
- Helps identify persistent struggles

---

## 6. Integration with Service Factory

Updated `backend/src/services/index.ts`:
```typescript
export class ServiceFactory {
  private userContextBuilder: UserContextBuilder;

  constructor(pool: Pool) {
    this.userContextBuilder = new UserContextBuilder(pool);
  }

  getUserContextBuilder(): UserContextBuilder {
    return this.userContextBuilder;
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Centralized dependency injection and service management

---

## 7. Comprehensive Test Suite

      ✓ should classify as intermediate for moderate performers
    calculateDifficulty
      ✓ should start at difficulty 1 for new users
      ✓ should increase difficulty for high performers with streaks
      ✓ should decrease difficulty for struggling users
      ✓ should maintain difficulty for consistent performers
    analyzeTopics

      ✓ should return 0 for empty history
    buildContext
      ✓ should build complete context from user data
    getContextSummary

## 9. Usage Example

```typescript
import { UserContextBuilder } from './services/userContextBuilder';

const builder = new UserContextBuilder(pool);
const context = await builder.buildContext('user-123');

console.log(builder.getContextSummary(context));
// Output: "User: user-123 | Level: intermediate | Difficulty: 3/5 |
//          Accuracy: 78.5% | Streak: 4 | Weak Topics: pico, alas |
//          Mastered: plumas | New Topics: cola, patas, garras"
```

```typescript
const prompt = `
Generate ${context.level}-level exercise at difficulty ${context.difficulty}/5.
Focus on: ${context.weakTopics.join(', ')}
Review: ${context.masteredTopics.join(', ')}
Introduce: ${context.newTopics.slice(0, 2).join(', ')}
`;
```

## 11. Database Integration

### Queries Used

**User Performance:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(CASE WHEN is_correct THEN 1 END), AVG(time_taken)
FROM exercise_results
WHERE session_id LIKE 'user-123%'
```

**Exercise History:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM exercise_results
WHERE session_id LIKE 'user-123%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Unexplored Topics:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT label_spanish FROM annotations
WHERE label_spanish NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT spanish_term FROM exercise_results
  WHERE session_id LIKE 'user-123%'
)
```

**Performance:**
- Queries limit to last 20-50 exercises
- Indexed on `session_id` and `created_at`
- Efficient aggregation queries

---

## 12. Cache Key Generation

**Strategy:** SHA-256 hash of deterministic context

**Hashed Elements:**
- User level
- Difficulty rating
- Weak topics (sorted)
- Mastered topics (sorted)
- New topics (sorted)

**Benefits:**
- Same context → same hash → cache hit
- Context changes → new hash → fresh exercises
- Automatic cache invalidation

**Implementation:**
```typescript
generateContextHash(context: Partial<UserContext>): string {
  const key = JSON.stringify({
    level: context.level,
    difficulty: context.difficulty,
    weakTopics: context.weakTopics?.sort(),
    masteredTopics: context.masteredTopics?.sort(),
    newTopics: context.newTopics?.sort()
  });

  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(key).digest('hex').substring(0, 16);
}
```

---

## 13. Next Steps
