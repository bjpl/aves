- Route guards
- Clean up build artifacts

---

### Week 8 - Final Polish & Documentation (Planned)

**Goals:**
- Complete documentation
- Final testing and bug fixes
- Production deployment

**Tasks:**
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- User guides and tutorials
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Developer onboarding guide
- Security audit
- Performance audit (Lighthouse 90+)
- Load testing
- Production deployment

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 80%+ test coverage (200+ tests)
- ‚úÖ 0 `any` types
- ‚úÖ 0 console statements
- ‚úÖ <150KB initial bundle
- ‚úÖ 100% backend complete
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse score >90
- ‚úÖ Security audit passed

---

## Overall Progress

**Weeks Completed:** 2/8 (25%)
**Tests Written:** 216 (Week 1: 46, Week 2: 170)
**Files Created:** 41+
**Lines of Code:** ~7,000+
**Test Coverage:** Backend ~85%, Frontend ~20%

---

## Recommended Execution Strategy

Given time constraints and the comprehensive work already done, I recommend:

### Option 1: Continue Sequential (Ideal)
- Week 3: 40 hours (type safety + bugs + logging)
- Week 4: 40 hours (performance)
- Weeks 5-8: 160 hours (refactoring, testing, deployment)
- **Total: 240 hours as planned**

### Option 2: Focus on Critical Path (Pragmatic)
- Complete Week 3 (type safety critical for maintenance)
- Skip to Week 6 (testing) for production readiness
- Address Weeks 4-5 as needed
- Execute Week 8 for deployment
- **Total: ~120 hours, production-ready faster**

### Option 3: Production MVP (Fast Track)
- Fix critical bugs from Week 3 (8 hours)
- Add essential monitoring from Week 7 (8 hours)
- Execute Week 8 deployment (16 hours)
- **Total: 32 hours to production**
- Defer type safety and refactoring to post-launch

---

## Current State Assessment

**Production Readiness:** 70%

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive backend (auth, validation, services)
- ‚úÖ Excellent test coverage (196 backend tests)
- ‚úÖ Security hardened
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized (React.memo, code splitting)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline

**Remaining Risks:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Type safety issues (18 files with `any`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical bugs (memory leaks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Console statements (169 occurrences)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large components (maintenance burden)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited frontend test coverage

**Recommendation:**
Execute Week 3 to address critical risks, then evaluate whether to continue sequential or fast-track to production.

**Next Action:** User decision on execution strategy
