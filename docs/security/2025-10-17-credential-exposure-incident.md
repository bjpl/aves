# Security Incident Report: Credential Exposure (2025-10-17)

## Incident Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Incident Type**: Credential Exposure in Uncommitted File

---

## What Happened

Real production credentials were accidentally added to `backend/.env.test` and staged for commit. The file contained:

- Supabase database password: `[REDACTED - 16 characters]`
- JWT secret: `[REDACTED - 64 character hex string]`
- Session secret: `[REDACTED - 64 character hex string]`
- Anthropic API key: `[REDACTED - sk-ant-api03-...]`

## Impact Assessment

**Exposure Level**: 🟡 **LOCAL ONLY**
- Credentials were **NOT committed** to git history
- Credentials were **NOT pushed** to remote repository
- Credentials were **only in git staging area**

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** (caught before commit)
- No public exposure occurred
- No unauthorized access detected
- Credentials remain secure

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Unstaged file**: `git restore --staged backend/.env.test`
2. ✅ **Reverted file**: `git checkout backend/.env.test`
3. ✅ **Added to .gitignore**: `backend/.env.test` and `frontend/.env.test`
4. ✅ **Created example file**: `backend/.env.test.example` with placeholders
5. ✅ **Documented incident**: This security report

## Credential Rotation Status

**Decision**: 🟢 **NO ROTATION REQUIRED**

**Rationale**:
- Credentials were **never committed** to git history
- No evidence of unauthorized access
- No public exposure occurred
- Files were only in local git staging area
- `.gitignore` now prevents future commits

**Monitoring**: Continue to monitor for any unusual activity

## Root Cause

**Why did this happen?**
- Developer working with real credentials for testing
- `.env.test` was not originally in `.gitignore`
- Changes were staged without reviewing sensitive content

**Why wasn't it caught earlier?**
- No pre-commit hooks for credential scanning
- Manual review process for git staging area

## Preventive Measures

### Immediate (Completed)

1. ✅ **Updated .gitignore**
   ```gitignore
   # Test environment files with real credentials
   backend/.env.test
   frontend/.env.test
   ```

2. ✅ **Created example files**
   - `backend/.env.test.example` with placeholders
   - Instructions for developers to copy and populate

3. ✅ **Verified git status**
   - Confirmed `.env.test` is no longer tracked
   - Confirmed no sensitive files in staging area

### Short-term (To Implement)

1. ⚠️ **Add pre-commit hooks**
   - Install `git-secrets` or similar tool
   - Scan for API keys, passwords, tokens
   - Prevent accidental commits of credentials

2. ⚠️ **CI/CD credential scanning**
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for secret scanning
   - Use tools like `trufflehog` or `gitleaks`
   - Alert on any detected secrets

3. ⚠️ **Developer documentation**
   - Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with security guidelines
   - Add credential management best practices
   - Create onboarding checklist for new developers

### Long-term (Planned)

1. 📋 **Environment variable injection**
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD credentials
   - Use local `.env.test.local` (gitignored) for development
   - Never commit real credentials, even to test files

2. 📋 **Secret rotation policy**
   - Establish regular credential rotation schedule
   - Document rotation procedures
   - Automate where possible

3. 📋 **Security training**
   - Regular security awareness for developers
   - Code review checklist including credential checks
   - Incident response procedures

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. ✅ **Early detection**: Issue caught during daily dev startup report
2. ✅ **Rapid response**: Fixed within 30 minutes of detection
3. ✅ **No damage**: Credentials never left local environment
4. ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive incident report created

### What Could Be Improved

1. ⚠️ **Prevention**: Need pre-commit hooks to prevent staging
2. ⚠️ **Process**: Better developer training on credential management
3. ⚠️ **Tooling**: Automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Verification

**Checklist**:
- ✅ `git status` shows no `.env.test` changes
- ✅ `.gitignore` includes `backend/.env.test`
- ✅ `.env.test.example` exists with placeholders
- ✅ No credentials in git staging area
- ✅ Security incident documented
- ✅ Preventive measures identified

## Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2025-10-17 Morning | Daily dev startup report identifies exposed credentials |
| 2025-10-17 10:00 AM | Incident confirmed - credentials in git staging area |
| 2025-10-17 10:05 AM | File unstaged and reverted |
| 2025-10-17 10:10 AM | `.gitignore` updated |
| 2025-10-17 10:15 AM | Example file created |
| 2025-10-17 10:20 AM | Incident report completed |
| 2025-10-17 10:25 AM | Verification completed |

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution**: Credentials secured, preventive measures in place, no rotation required.

**Next Steps**: Implement pre-commit hooks and CI/CD secret scanning (see Short-term measures above).
