## Bug Details

### Description
[Provide a clear, detailed description of the bug]

**Example**:
> When clicking on a bird annotation in the interactive image viewer, the Spanish term should be revealed. However, on mobile devices (iOS Safari), tapping the annotation does nothing. The hover state works on desktop, but touch events don't trigger the disclosure.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
4. [Final step]

**Example**:
1. Open the app on iPhone 14 (iOS 17.1) using Safari
2. Navigate to "Learn" > Select "Petirrojo" (Robin)
3. Tap on the "pico" (beak) annotation on the bird image
4. Observe that nothing happens (no Spanish term revealed)

---

### Expected Behavior
[What should happen?]

**Example**:
> Tapping the annotation should progress through the 5-level disclosure system:
> 1. Tap 1: Spanish term "pico" appears
> 2. Tap 2: English translation "beak" appears
> 3. Tap 3: Etymology shown
> 4. Tap 4: Example sentence displayed

---

### Actual Behavior
[What actually happens?]

**Example**:
> Nothing happens when tapping. The annotation remains in its default state. No errors appear in the console. The hover state works on desktop, suggesting a touch event handling issue.

---

## Technical Details (for developers)

### Suspected Cause
[Your hypothesis about what's causing the bug]

**Example**:
> The annotation component likely uses `onMouseEnter` and `onClick` handlers but doesn't implement touch event handlers (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`). This is a common React event handling issue on mobile.

### Relevant Code Locations
- **File**: [e.g., `frontend/src/components/annotations/InteractiveAnnotation.tsx`]
- **Line**: [e.g., Line 145-160]
- **Function**: [e.g., `handleAnnotationClick()`]

### Console Output
```javascript
// Paste any relevant console logs, errors, or warnings
```

### Network Activity
- [ ] No network requests made
- [ ] Network request failed (see details below)
- [ ] Network request succeeded but wrong data returned

**Request details**:
```
URL: [e.g., /api/annotations/123]
Method: [GET, POST, etc.]
Status: [e.g., 200, 404, 500]
Response: [Paste relevant response data]
```

## Regression Testing

**Was this feature working before?**
- [ ] Yes - this is a regression (worked in version: _____)
- [ ] No - this is a new bug
- [ ] Unknown

## Suggested Fix (optional)

**Proposed solution**:
[If you have ideas for how to fix this, describe them here]

**Example**:
> Add touch event handlers to the InteractiveAnnotation component:
> - Replace `onMouseEnter` with both `onMouseEnter` and `onTouchStart`
> - Replace `onClick` with both `onClick` and `onTouchEnd`
> - Prevent default touch behavior to avoid double-firing
> - Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome

**Estimated effort**:
- [ ] Low (< 1 hour)
- [ ] Medium (1-4 hours)
- [ ] High (> 4 hours)

- [ ] Low (quick fix)
- [ ] Medium (moderate effort)
- [ ] High (significant work)

**Impact** (How many users affected?)
- [ ] High (all/most users)
- [ ] Medium (some users)
- [ ] Low (few users)

**Overall Priority**: [Calculated from above]
- [ ] P0 (Critical - drop everything)
- [ ] P1 (High - fix ASAP)
- [ ] P2 (Medium - fix soon)
- [ ] P3 (Low - fix when time allows)
