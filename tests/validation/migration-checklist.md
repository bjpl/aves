# Test Migration Validation Checklist

## Pre-Migration Assessment
- [x] Baseline test metrics captured
- [x] Test inventory documented
- [x] Test frameworks identified (Vitest, Jest)
- [x] Current test structure analyzed

## Migration Quality Criteria

### 1. Functional Correctness
- [ ] All tests pass after migration
- [ ] No new test failures introduced
- [ ] Test assertions remain equivalent
- [ ] Edge cases still covered
- [ ] Error handling preserved

### 2. Code Quality
- [ ] Reduced boilerplate code (target: 30-40% reduction)
- [ ] Improved readability scores
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper test organization

### 3. Performance
- [ ] Test execution time maintained or improved
- [ ] No timeout issues
- [ ] Memory usage acceptable
- [ ] Parallel execution compatible

### 4. Maintainability
- [ ] Clear test descriptions
- [ ] Reusable test utilities
- [ ] Minimal duplication
- [ ] Easy to debug failures
- [ ] Well-documented patterns

### 5. Coverage
- [ ] Code coverage percentage maintained (>85%)
- [ ] Branch coverage maintained (>75%)
- [ ] Statement coverage maintained (>80%)
- [ ] Function coverage maintained (>80%)

## Test-Specific Validation

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Mock setup simplified
- [ ] Assertions clearer
- [ ] Setup/teardown optimized
- [ ] Fast execution (<100ms per test)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Database mocking improved
- [ ] API mocking streamlined
- [ ] Async handling simplified
- [ ] Error scenarios covered

### Component Tests
- [ ] React Query testing enhanced
- [ ] User interaction tests clear
- [ ] Accessibility checks included
- [ ] Visual regression potential

## Post-Migration Verification

### Console Output
- [ ] No console warnings
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Clean deprecation warnings
- [ ] Proper test reporter output

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Faster to write new tests
- [ ] Easier to understand existing tests
- [ ] Better IDE support
- [ ] Improved debugging experience

### Documentation
- [ ] Migration patterns documented
- [ ] Best practices updated
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Common pitfalls noted

## Rollback Criteria

Migration should be rolled back if:
- More than 5% of tests fail after migration
- Test execution time increases by >50%
- Code coverage drops by >10%
- Critical functionality breaks
- Team consensus against changes

## Sign-Off Requirements

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team training completed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
